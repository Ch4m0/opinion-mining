Sentiment Analysis For New Electronic Products
===================================
Input: 
Users' online reviews from two technological websites: techcrunch.com and cnet.com for new iPhone 5.

Output:
Mining people opinions about new iPhone 5

Technical Description:
Goal:
The goal was to find out what people think about the new iPhone 5 which has been released yesterday Spetember 12, 2012 [1].

Crawling Step and Generating Clean Raw Data:
I wrote a simple crawler to pull out people's comments from techcrunch.com and cnet.com websites where they had discussed the new Apple phone. This crawler basically downloads all reviews made by people. Next, the Beautiful Soup Python library was used for pulling data out of HTML pages in a nice and clean way[2].

Sentiment Analysis using PycURL and text-processing API:
For the next step, I wanted to use some machine learning algortihms for sentiment analysis in order to find out what people think about the iPhone 5. However, for the test purpose I found an available API for sentiment analysis with Python NLTK [3]. Therefore, I used this website API in order to analyze the polarity of the comments regard to iPhone 5. For sending HTTP requests to the text-processing website, I found a very nice Python library called PycURL. PycURL is a Python interface to libcurl [4].

Results:
For techcrunch.com, I collected 79 comments in total where 10 of them were labeled neutral, 13 positive, and 56 of them were labelled negative respect to the topic (iPhone 5):
pos=16.4%
neutral=12.6%
neg=71%

For cnet.com, I also collected 37 comments in total where 5 of them were labeled neutral, 7 positive, and 25 of them were labelled negative:
pos=19%
neutral=13.5
neg=67%

Even if our dataset is limited, our results are relatively consistent. The average results considering the data from both websites are:
pos=17.7%
neutral=13.05%
neg=69%

The above data just shows how people felt about the new iPhone release after its demo on September 12, 2012 and it does not reflect the developer's opinion.
